**Conclusion Summary**


Trained a custom YOLOv7 object detection model on the Graymatics dataset containing 2 classes.

Converted the provided COCO-format annotations (.json) to YOLO format (.txt) successfully.

Created a proper data.yaml file and trained the model for 25 epochs using Google Colab with Tesla T4 GPU.

Achieved excellent results with:

Precision: 0.995

Recall: 0.999

mAP@0.5: 0.997

mAP@0.5:0.95: 0.859

Performed inference on a public YouTube video, saved the output.

All deliverables (training logs, results, inference output) have been generated and are ready for submission.

The project meets all specified task requirements and demonstrates accurate real-world detection capability.
